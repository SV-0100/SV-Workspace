Location : primal void -nothing exists
the orbs were one - of red energy(Chaos) and other-of dark energy(Darkness)
two particles(orbs of energy) continuously collide with each other and destroy each other repeating this over a infinitely times.
upon one random collision half energy from each orbs mixed to create a third entity . it was shaped in the form of a Gyroelongated square bipyramid (God Stone).
the new entity was new to the environment without a pupose.
the other half of the energy fom the two orbs unable to fuse together infused themselves into the void.
the god stone drifted in the void and suddenly due to two different energies present in its medium they began to form a perfect syncronization.
the pointed ends of the GS began to draw the energy from the void this consumption of the energy began to empower GS and this created new worlds within the GS - a total of 6 worlds 

but consumption of void energy stimulated the awakning of the cosmic beast (azathoth)-an amalgumation of void and the energy of the other halfs of the orbs.

As the GS was consuming the void energy a loud ring started to emit that rang throughout the void.
this ring caused great pain to  azathoth.
the beast began to advanse to destroy one that was causing it great pain .
but the ring also had a sleep effect and intense pain effect on the beast.the beast fell into an deep slumber that can only be woken when the God Stone Forge stops.

though in slumber the beast was able to indirectly influnce the worlds of the GS through its Dreams.

WORLDS: 4
    Techological world
    Fantasy world
    biblical World
    Spritual world
    
    SUB-WORLDS:8

    

the AB influnce on all creatures exists always but it takes its true manistification when a being with sufficient energy and will to destroy is made.
it doesnt try to control them only that it gives them its primal energy to aid it.
this in turn helps the individual to grow at an accelerated phase and once the presence of ABs energy within a certain domain grows to a certain limit the world begins to collapse in on itself and the GS becomes weaker.
